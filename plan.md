- Goals
  - Implement a simple command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the store.
  - Support basic operations: put, get, delete, list keys.
  - Provide options for configuring store parameters (e.g., segment size, durability mode).

- Baby steps
  1. Set up a CLI framework using argparse or click.
  2. Implement commands for put, get, delete operations.
  3. Add a command to list all keys in the store.
  4. Add options for configuring store parameters via command-line arguments.
  5. Write tests for CLI commands to ensure correct behavior.
  6. Document CLI usage in README or separate docs.

- Acceptance
  - CLI works as expected for all operations.
  - Configuration options are applied correctly.
  - Tests cover all CLI commands.
  - Documentation provides clear usage instructions.

---

### Phase 3.8 - Add structured logging

- Goals
  - Implement structured logging for better observability and debugging.
  - Use a logging library that supports different log levels and formats (e.g., JSON).
  - Log key events such as store operations, errors, recovery steps, and performance metrics.

- Baby steps
  1. Choose a logging library (e.g., Python's built-in logging with JSON formatter).
  2. Set up a logging configuration that supports different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR).
  3. Replace print statements with appropriate logging calls throughout the codebase.
  4. Add structured log messages for key events (e.g., "PUT key", "GET key", "Segment rotated").
  5. Document logging configuration and usage in README or separate docs.

- Acceptance
  - Logging is implemented consistently across the codebase.
  - Log messages are structured and provide useful context.
  - Logging configuration is documented.

---

## Phase 3.9 - Store Server implementation (Optional, nice to have)

- Goals
  - Implement a simple TCP Server or API Server using Flask/FastAPI for remote access to the store.
  - Support basic operations: put, get, delete via a simple protocol (e.g., JSON over TCP).
  - Handle multiple concurrent client connections.

- Baby steps
  1. Set up a basic TCP server or Flask/FastAPI app.
  2. Implement endpoints or commands for put, get, delete operations.
  3. Add concurrency support (threading or async) to handle multiple clients.
  4. Make sure we add locks to ensure thread safety.
  5. Write tests for server endpoints to ensure correct behavior.
  6. Document server usage in README or separate docs.

- Acceptance
  - Server works as expected for all operations.
  - Handles multiple concurrent clients without data corruption.
  - Tests cover all server endpoints.
  - Documentation provides clear usage instructions.

---

## Phase 4 — Compaction (Merge) and Tombstones

- Goals
  - Implement compaction (merge) to remove historical versions and tombstones and reclaim space.

- Baby steps
  1. Design compaction strategy: choose some segments to merge into a new compacted segment by copying only the latest live keys.
  2. Implement a merger process that reads old segments, writes live records to a new segment, builds a new index for that segment.
  3. Swap segments atomically (use rename) and delete old segments after swap.
  4. Add tombstone handling: deletes are preserved long enough to ensure replication/durability, then removed by compaction.
  5. Add tests for compaction correctness, atomic swap behavior, and crash during compaction (partial compaction should not break correctness).

- Acceptance
  - Compaction reclaims space and leaves store in consistent state even on crash mid-compaction.

- Experiments
  - Measure disk footprint before/after compaction and compaction throughput.

---

## Phase 6 — Durability and Crash Consistency

- Goals
  - Decide durability model and implement safe flushing options (fsync per write, batched fsync, or background).

- Baby steps
  1. Add configurable durability levels: `no-fsync`, `fsync-on-append`, `periodic-fsync`.
  2. Implement atomic index persistence (if you persist index externally): write to temp file then atomic rename.
  3. Add tests that simulate sudden power loss (truncate file mid-record) and check recovery semantics for each durability mode.

- Acceptance
  - Behavior matches documented durability guarantees for each mode.

- Tradeoffs
  - Per-write fsync = stronger durability, lower throughput; batched fsync = higher throughput, potential data loss window.

---

## Phase 7 — Concurrency and Locking

- Goals
  - Make the store safe under concurrent readers and writers (threads/processes).

- Baby steps
  1. Decide concurrency model: single-writer multiple-reader (Bitcask-style) or concurrent writers with file-level locking.
  2. Implement in-process locks (`threading.RLock`) for internal state; for multi-process, use a file lock mechanism.
  3. Ensure compaction runs without blocking reads; coordinate compaction and active writers.
  4. Add tests with many concurrent readers/writers verifying correctness.

- Acceptance
  - No data races or corruption in multi-threaded tests; cross-process locking prevents concurrent writers from corrupting segments.

---

## Phase 8 — Performance Improvements

- **Goals**
  - Optimize for speed and memory usage
  - Add performance monitoring
  - Tune critical paths
  - Add bloom filters to reduce unnecessary disk reads

- **Baby steps**
  1. Add memory-mapped file reads for better performance
  2. Implement batched writes to reduce syscall overhead  
  3. Profile and optimize hot paths
  4. Add performance benchmarks
  5. Consider compression for values
  6. Add bloom filters per segment to reduce disk reads

- **Acceptance**
  - Measurable performance improvements
  - Benchmark suite shows progress
  - Bloom filters reduce unnecessary disk reads

---

## Phase 9 — Advanced Index Enhancements (1–2 weeks)

- **Goals**
  - Reduce memory footprint for large keyspaces
  - Add bloom filters for faster negative lookups
  - Implement index persistence optimizations

- **Baby steps**
  1. Add bloom filters per segment to reduce disk reads
  2. Implement tiered indexing (hot vs cold keys)
  3. Add binary index format for reduced memory usage
  4. Optimize index recovery performance

- **Acceptance**
  - Reduced memory usage for large datasets
  - Faster negative lookups with bloom filters

---

## Phase 10 — Testing, Benchmarks, and Observability

- **Goals**
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Production monitoring capabilities

- **Baby steps** (many already done!)
  1. ✅ Deterministic unit tests for all components
  2. ✅ Integration tests for segment and hash table recovery
  3. Add end-to-end integration tests for store operations
  4. Create benchmark suite for operations/sec measurements
  5. Add metrics collection and logging
  6. Chaos testing (random failures, corruption)

- **Acceptance**
  - High test coverage with reliable failure detection
  - Reproducible benchmarks
  - Good observability for production use

---

## Phase 11 — System design extensions (weeks)

- Goals
  - Add basic replication (leader-follower) or sharding for distributed scenarios.
  - Explore networking layer for remote access.
  - Add sharding for horizontal scaling.
  - Consider eventual consistency models.

- Baby steps
  1. Implement an append-only replication stream from leader to followers (simple TCP-based tailing).
  2. Ensure idempotence: follower applies each record once; handle gaps on reconnect.
  3. Consider consistent hashing for sharding keys across multiple instances.
  4. Add tests to simulate follower lag and recovery.

- Acceptance
  - Followers converge to leader state; simple failure/reconnect scenarios handled.

---

## Project hygiene & micro-tasks (apply each phase)

- Always: write tests for each new invariant before/after implementing change.
- Use small commits with meaningful messages: "phase1: add append-only record format", etc.
- Keep a `CHANGELOG.md` describing behavior and assumptions (durability, atomicity).
- Document CLI/test scripts for running benchmarks and failure scenarios.

---

## Design decision checklist (document for every phase)

- Record format (header fields + checksum).
- Durability guarantees and default mode.
- Concurrency model (single-writer vs multi-writer).
- Compaction trigger policy and safety.
- Index persistence (in-memory vs snapshot).
- Failure modes and recovery strategy.

---

## Minimal file layout suggestion (no code; for organization)

- package root (e.g., `bitcaskpy/`)
  - core module (KV store, segment management)
  - compactor module
  - index module
  - io module (file operations, format helpers)
  - `tests/`
  - `benchmarks/`
  - `scripts/` (tools for running experiments)
  - `docs/` (design notes, tradeoffs, experiments)

---

## Small, safe experiments to run early

- Write many small keys (e.g., 10M keys) to test index memory pressure.
- Measure restart time vs number of segments and with/without persisted index snapshot.
- Test crash recovery: kill process during write, compaction, and index snapshot.

---

## Recommended reading & tools

- The Bitcask article (primary design source) and related Basho blog posts.
- “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” (for tradeoffs, durability, replication).
- Python tools: `pytest` for tests, `timeit`/`asyncio` for benchmarks, `mmap`, `struct`, `filelock` or `portalocker` for cross-process locks.
- Profilers: `py-spy`, `cProfile` to find hotspots.
